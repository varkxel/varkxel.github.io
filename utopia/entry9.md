# Entry 9 - Refractoring & Code Cleanup
For the majority of this week, I focused on fixing up the code to be more presentable and maintainable,
since a lot of the features I recently implemented were rushed to try and flesh out and polish the project.
This means some time is needed to bring the code up to standard.

The result of this will still feel the same to play and use,
but will make future development much easier.
