# Entry 1 - The Idea
## Introduction
The basic idea for the project is to create a procedural island (with a road network as a stretch goal), using Unity's Burst compiler and job system.

## Creating an island
To generate this island, I will be using fractal simplex noise with a mask applied.
This mask will be generated by first creating a mesh from a random set of angles, along with a set of extrusions generated from 1D smooth noise.
This mesh will then be rendered on the GPU via a custom shader that will add jittering (if required) to the vertices
and also apply a gradient filter to the result. This result could also be smoothed via an image effect shader if required.

Once this mask has been generated, the heightmap can be multiplied by it to shape it into an island.

## Noise implementation
I found an old implementation of 2D simplex noise that I translated from GLSL to C#/Burst,
using this implementation [here](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/blob/master/src/noise3D.glsl).
I can utilise this implementation for most of the 2D noise maps required for the island generation, and the implementation should be drop-in.
