# Entry 4 - Inspectors & Biome Work
## Biome Inspector
This week was mostly spent implementing an inspector for the biome map to view the noise maps
and help with the development of the biomes.

The implementation was just a simple script to run the biome generator,
pack the result into a texture, then display that texture below the default inspector.

I then used this to test the noise algorithms and biome generator, which very much helped development.
