# Entry 5 - Finishing up Biomes & Mesh Generation
## Extending the inspector to masks
Since there are multiple assets that generate textures,
I made a generic "texture inspector" that each type could extend from.
It works in the same way across all the inspectors, cutting down on duplicate code.

Having more generated textures being visible has helped with customizing/fixing other bits of the code, so this has definitely been worth the effort.
