					<h1>The Wyevern Development Blog</h1>
					<p>
						Wyevern is my Game Engine pet project, where I slowly develop a toolset to
						which what eventually will become (to me, at least) the ultimate game engine.
					</p>
					<h2>Core Design Principles</h2>
					<p>
						This game engine is developed around certain core design principles,
						in which I have decided during my use, love and frustration of other game engines on the market today.
					</p>
					<h3>Modularity and Extendability</h3>
					<p>The game engine should be highly modular - as modular as possible in fact.</p>
					<p>
						Most engines on the market today are absolutely amazing at just doing anything you throw at them for most common use cases.
						This is obviously really good for everyone.
						The problem with this however is that you can't switch off or disable all the features you don't actually want or require,
						leading to bloated projects, longer iteration times and just generally a slower product.
						Plus, I just generally find that I don't use 90% of the features of most mainstream engines nowadays,
						I end up rolling out my own. Maybe that's why I'm developing this engine??
					</p>
					<p>
						My goal for this engine is that if there's a part of the engine you're just not interested in,
						you can just not include it. Everything is a module!
						This will also help out with customisation.
						For example, if you don't want to roll the renderer that comes with the engine - just remove and fork it!
					</p>
					<h3>No editor, unless you want it.</h3>
					<p>
						I aim for the datatypes used by this engine to be implemented in a scripting language, rather than as pure data.
						The reason for this is to be able to programatically create levels, without ever having touching the editor.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anything you can do in the editor will boil down to a set of commands in a console.
						This will also help to make sure what happens within the editor is what happens in the game.
					</p>
					<h3>Threaded by design</h3>
					<p>
						Code written for the engine should revolve around the job system in order to maximise the available performance
						and minimise single-core workload for all projects.
